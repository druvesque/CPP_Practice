multiple inheritance - one class derived from 2 classes

x,y (parent), z (child): z inherits properties of both x and y class


multi-level inheritance - (z --> y --> x)

hierarchical inheritance - (a --> x, y, z) : multiple childs from single
class

hybird : when a sub-class is inherited from multiple base-class and all of
it's base classes are inherited from a single class

(w --> x,y) (x,y --> z) this creates a hybrid class structure


Order of Constructors and Destructors during Inheritance

(x --> y --> z)

-- contructors are executed in the order of derivation
-- destructors are executed in reverse order of derivation
